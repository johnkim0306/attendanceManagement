# Vita-Attendance
Vita-Attendance is an intuitive and efficient attendance management system built using cutting-edge web technologies. This project leverages the new app route feature in Next.js 14, integrating NextAuth and TypeORM as the core technology stack to streamline and optimize user authentication and data management.

## Technology Stack
- **Next.js 14**: A framework for building modern React applications. This project specifically utilizes the app route feature in Next.js 14 for more concise and efficient page routing and data fetching.
- **NextAuth**: A simple yet powerful authentication solution. Easily integrates with Next.js applications for user authentication and session management.
- **TypeORM**: An ORM designed for TypeScript, supporting a wide range of databases and making data modeling and management easier.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework that enables rapid UI development by providing pre-defined classes directly in your markup.
- **Jest**: A robust JavaScript testing framework designed to ensure code reliability through unit and integration tests.
- **MySQL**: As the database for storing data.
